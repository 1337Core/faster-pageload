Fast Pageload uses preloading to make your browsing experience feel more fluent and the web overall faster. It preloads links on mouse hover and makes them instantly available when you click them. This way, you can navigate faster and more efficiently.

## Maintenance Notice
This is a maintained verizon of the original Fast Pageload extension. The core functionality remains based on the original work, but this repository is actively maintained with updates and improvements.
